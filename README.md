SNS Push is a simple SNS SDK wrapper with a collection of methods to aid in interacting with the AWS SNS API. It works directly with Laravel or can be used as a standalone PHP package.

# Prerequisites

 Supports  | Version
:----------|:----------
 PHP       | 7.0
 Platforms | ios/android
 
# Installing
 
You need to use Composer to install SNS Push into your project:
 
```
composer require redu/sns-push
```
 
## Configuring (Laravel)
 
Now you have to include `SNSPushServiceProvider` in your `config/app.php`:
 
```php
'providers' => [
    /*
     * Package Service Providers...
     */
    SNSPush\SNSPushServiceProvider::class,
]
```

## Other PHP Framework (not Laravel) Setup

You should include the Composer `autoload` file if not already loaded:

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
 ```

# Usage

Instantiate the SNSPush class with the following required config values: account_id, access_key, secret_key, platform_applications
 
Also configurable: region(eu-west-1), api_version(2010-03-31), scheme(http/s)
```php
$sns = new SNSPush([
    'account_id' => '<aws-account-id>', // Required
    'access_key' => '<aws-iam-user-access-key>', // Required
    'secret_key' => '<aws-iam-user-secret-key>', // Required
    'scheme' => 'http', // Defaults to https
    'platform_applications' => [ // Required
        'ios' => '...',
        'android' => '...'
    ]
]);
```

## Add device to Application

Add a device to a platform application (ios/android) by passing the device token and application key to `addDevice()`.

```php
$sns->addDevice('<device-token>, 'ios');
```

## Remove Device from Application

Remove a device from AWS SNS by passing the Endpoint ARN to `removeDevice()`.

```php
$sns->removeDevice('<endpoint-arn>');
```

## Subscribe Device to Topic

Subscribe a device to a Topic by passing the Endpoint Arn and Topic Arn

```php
$sns->subscribeDeviceToTopic('<endpoint-arn>', '<topic-arn>');
```

## Remove Device from Topic

Remove a device from a Topic by passing the Subscription Arn to `removeDeviceFromTopic()`.

```php
$sns->removeDeviceFromTopic('<subscription-arn>');
```

## Sending Push Notifications

SNS Push supports sending notifications to both Topic Endpoint or directly to an Endpoint ARN (Device).

### Send to Device

```php
$message = 'Push notification message.';

$sns->sendPushNotification(
    '<endpoint-arn>', 
    SNSPush::TYPE_ENDPOINT, 
    $message
);
```

You can also optionally send a custom payload along with the message.

```php
$sns->sendPushNotification('<endpoint-arn>', SNSPush::TYPE_ENDPOINT, $message, [
    'payload' => [
        'id' => 9
    ]
]);
```

The message structure is sent as JSON and will be properly formatted per device. This is a requirement if sending to multiple platforms and/or sending a custom payload.

If you are only sending a simple message to a single platform and would like to save on bytes you can set the message structure to a string.

```php
$sns->sendPushNotification('<endpoint-arn>', SNSPush::TYPE_ENDPOINT, $message, [
    'message_structure' => 'string'
]);
```

### Send to Topic

```php
$message = 'Push notification message.';

$sns->send->sendPushNotification(
    '<topic-arn>', 
    SNSPush::TYPE_TOPIC, 
    $message
);
```

Similarly, you can set the message structure and payload.

Convenience methods are available:

```php
$sns->sendEndpointPushNotification(<endpoint-arn>, $message, $options);
$sns->sendTopicPushNotification(<topic-arn>, $message, $options);
```

## To do
- Support more endpoints
- Test, test, test... (still in early development, use with caution)
